# Digit-recognition
This repository contains a solution for a real problem of digit recognition.
A windows application with digit recognition using deep learning <b>from scratch</b>

Using this repository, one may train L-layer neural networks with sigmoid/tanh activations from scratch for a 10-class problem of digits recognition.
Also in this Digit-recognition repository a multi-threading application is available for testing a trained model.
